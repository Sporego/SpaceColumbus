1. crystal clusters = one mesh for many crystals to speed up transluency shader (per model grab pass)

    problems: 

        - must find correct root placement for each crystal (3d model + terrain)

        - in shader, for each crystal, need to compute emission from crystal root, but in a cluster dont know where is root, which crystal belong to
            solution: use y of crystal for light? use center of cluster for light? -> i.e. center crystals are better?


2. entity manager / destroy system
    
    - must safe guard all other systems:
        when entity is destroyed, must make sure all other systems dont try to access it


3. entity clustering system
    
    - helps with finding closest objects
    - on UPDATE, loop over all entities and cluster entities into squares, look in NxN squares for closest objects based on a <RANGE> parameter


4. Region split into multiple mesh objects
    
    - merge points must have no gaps
    - correct navmesh generation


5. Health System / Damage

    Dwarf Fortress Injury Types:
        NONE: No recorded active wounds on the part.
        MINOR: Any damage that doesn't have functional/structural consequences (might be heavy bleeding, though).
        INHIBITED: Any muscular, structural, or functional damage, without total loss.
        FUNCTION LOSS: An important function of the part is completely lost, but the part is structurally sound (or at least partially intact).
        BROKEN: The part has lost all structural integrity or muscular ability.
        MISSING: The part is completely gone.


6. Entity bodies / materials


7. BUG: MoveBrain movement; when multiple agents are told to move to X, not all agents actually start moving to X (command ignored).
